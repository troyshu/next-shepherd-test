      Shepherd is a JavaScript library for guiding users through your app.
      It uses <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Popper.js</a>,
      another open source library, to render dialogs for each tour "step".
      </p>

      <p>
      Among many things, Popper makes sure your steps never end up off screen or
      cropped by an overflow. (Try resizing your browser to see what we mean.)
